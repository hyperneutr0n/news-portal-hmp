      "For centuries, engineers have marveled at Roman structures like the Pantheon and the Colosseum, which have withstood millennia of wear and tear. A new study from MIT and Harvard researchers, published in 'Science Advances,' reveals the key ingredient was not just volcanic ash, but the process of 'hot mixing.' \n\nPraesent ac sem eget est egestas volutpat.

Donec odio urna, tempus molestie, porttitor ut, iaculis quis, sem. \n\nThe study found that by adding quicklime directly to the mix, the resulting high temperatures created unique lime clasts. When cracks later form in the concrete and water seeps in, these clasts dissolve and recrystallize, effectively healing the cracks. This self-healing property is what has allowed the structures to last so long. The findings could pave the way for a new generation of more sustainable and resilient concrete.",
